# React & Redux by Prashant Sir
## What is React ?
  - JavaScript Library to build Dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
  - Build by Facebook at 2011.
  - Currently, most widely used JS library for front-end development.
  - Used to create **SPA** single page web application.
  - At the end the React code is going to get converted into the JS only.
  - Library is the pre-defined code which you can use to develop the project fast.
## Working of DOM (Document-object-model) ?
  - Browser takes HTML and create DOM.
  - JavaScript helps us modify DOM based on user actions or events.
  - In big applications, Working with DOM becomes complicated.
  - When the browser tries to load the web application it asks the files from the server.
  - After receiving the HTML file it creates the DOM structure which is a tree structure of HTML elements.
  - Then it will explore the CSS to add the styling to these HTML elements. 
## Problems with JavaScript 
  - React has a simpler mental model.
  - JavaScript is cumbersome.
  - JavaScript is Error-Prone.
  - JavaScript is hard to maintain.
  - Maintaining the project is more complex rather than developing the application.

## Working of React
  - No need to worry about querying and updating the DOM.
  - React creates a web page with small and reusable component.
  - React will take care of creating and updating DOM element.
  - It saves a lot of time.
